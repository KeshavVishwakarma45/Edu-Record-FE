## Using the Postman collection

1. Postman → Import → choose both JSON files. Select the **EduRecords local** environment.
2. Run **Auth → Login**. It saves `accessToken` and `instituteId` (the first institute) for you.
3. Run any **Courses** request. To try another institute, copy an id from the Login response
   into the `instituteId` variable.
4. Try the security checks: set `instituteId` to an institute the user cannot access and
   expect **403**; log in as a TC clerk (9100000003) and **Create course** expecting **403**.

Never put real student data in screenshots, Postman examples or WhatsApp.
