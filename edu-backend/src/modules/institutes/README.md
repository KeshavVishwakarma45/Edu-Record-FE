# institutes: organisation setup (Module A)

**Owner:** Module A (S1 backend, S3 frontend in Phase 1). Builds the Setup screens (SRS screen 3).

The **models already exist** here (built in the skeleton, used by login and courses):
`tenant.model.js`, `institute.model.js`, `university.model.js`, `affiliation.model.js`, `department.model.js`.
Add validation, service, controller and routes for each, copying `modules/courses`.

Notes:

- `universities` and `tenants` have no `tenantId` (shared master / the tenant itself). Only PLATFORM_ADMIN may change universities.
- Images (logo, seal, signature) are uploaded with `middleware/upload.js` and saved with `utils/storage.js`; store the returned File id.
